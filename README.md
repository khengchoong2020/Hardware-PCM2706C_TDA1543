PCM2706C and I2S NOS TDA1543 active current output
This is a Hardware project built on PM2706C, an TI USB to I2S converter to 4X TDA1543 (I2S version) NOS 16-bit audio DAC. The DAC output is built on active Op Amp (NE5532) for current-to-voltage conversion and 51KHz cut-off active filter with Op-Amp (NE5532).
